## Live Demo

Live demo here: :arrow_right: [Vanilla JS Calculator](https://calc-project-vanilla-js.netlify.app/)

## Description
Written in vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS. 
I used CSS grid system for this project. While writing JS part, I intentionally not used built-in eval() function, I wanted completely implement my own solution.
You can chain multiple calculations like: 30 + 12 * 3 - 1, also It's working with decimal points.
There is functionality to use it with a keyboard or mouse (in mobile touching).

I also ported this project to React.
